# YouTube Clone App with React and Tailwind CSS

This project is a YouTube clone application built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It includes various features such as API caching for search suggestions and search results, debouncing for search functionality, nested comments, and a live chat.

## Features

### 1. API Caching
The application implements API caching for both search suggestions and search results. This ensures faster response times and reduces the number of API calls made to retrieve data.

### 2. Debouncing for Search
Search functionality is enhanced with debouncing, which helps in optimizing performance by delaying the execution of the search function until the user has stopped typing. This prevents unnecessary API calls and enhances the user experience.

### 3. Nested Comments
The app supports an unlimited number of nested comments, providing a hierarchical structure for discussions. Users can reply to existing comments and create threads within threads, facilitating deeper conversations.

### 4. Live Chat
A live chat feature is integrated into the application, allowing users to engage in real-time conversations. Please note that the chat functionality is hard-coded and does not involve server-side interactions.
